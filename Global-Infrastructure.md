# AWS Global Infrastructure

## Traditional Data Centers

Before cloud computing companies had to manage physical computation resources themselves. This meant a room full of servers, cables, and people that needed to understand how all of these things worked. This room is called a data center.

## AWS vs. Traditional Data Centers

With AWS you are paying to use Amazon's machines. They manage the data centers, not you. 

One advantage of this is that you can just pay for what you need. In the past companies would have to commit to buying servers. This is a big commitment, and it would be easy to overestimate or underestimate your needs. 

You might not have money to buy servers. You might only need them for one month of the year, or one hour of the day. This is why it is better to just pay for what you need with AWS.

## Global Infrastructure

AWS has lots of data centers so that it can meet the needs of huge companies like Amazon and Netflix.

A cluster of data centers is called a **region**. Within this cluster there are more clusters called availability zones.

The reason for having physically separate availability zones is that the region is more fault-tolerant in case of a natural disaster. 

Availabilty zones within a region are connected with redundant, high-bandwidth, low-latency networking. Data centers within the availability zone are also connected.
